## ✒️ Typography

### Primary Header Font  
**Mortuary** (or similar Gothic serif)  
Bold, serif type with high contrast strokes. It evokes tradition, structure, and formality while remaining warm and personal.

### Body Font  
**Modern Sans-Serif** (e.g., Inter, Jost)  
Used for subheadings and utility text (e.g., "Funeral Coordination, Planning & Support"). Clean, accessible, and minimal to complement the primary serif font.

## 🕊 Brand Feel

- **Timeless & Reverent:** Echoes the atmosphere of cathedrals, heirlooms, and hand-carved stone.
- **Sacred & Grounded:** Feels like a walk through an old garden or a handwritten note left behind.
- **Minimal & Intimate:** Clean design with emotional warmth; avoids clinical or corporate overtones.

## 🌸 Logo

A delicate floral emblem enclosed in an oval represents memory, life cycles, and care. It balances strength and softness — the flower is stylized, not overly intricate, making it feel modern yet meaningful.

---

## Usage Notes

- Pair serif headers with simple sans-serif body text for contrast.
- Maintain ample whitespace around the logo and content for a calm, respectful visual rhythm.
- Avoid overly bright or saturated tones — subtlety reinforces the brand's emotional integrity.
