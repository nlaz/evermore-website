## 🕊 Brand Feel

- **Timeless & Reverent:** Echoes the atmosphere of cathedrals, heirlooms, and hand-carved stone.
- **Sacred & Grounded:** Feels like a walk through an old garden or a handwritten note left behind.
- **Minimal & Intimate:** Clean design with emotional warmth; avoids clinical or corporate overtones.
