# Evermore Funeral Coordination, Planning & Support  
## Website Design Description

Imagine landing on Evermore's homepage and being immediately drawn into a serene, gallery‑style layout where generous swaths of Soft Ivory serve as your canvas. A full‑width hero panel features a softly embossed floral emblem in Forest Charcoal, paired with a Mortuary‑style serif headline that reads "Honoring Legacies, Evermore." Below, content sections are arranged in a gentle asymmetric grid—text blocks in elegant body type (Inter or Jost) float alongside full‑bleed photo panels of quiet gardens, candlelit interiors, or hands arranging forget‑me‑nots. Subtle hover animations—like a faint olive‑green underline creeping in beneath links—reinforce an intimate, tactile feel without ever feeling "gimmicky." Navigation is tucked into a minimal off‑white header bar, with understated iconography and clear utility buttons in Moss Olive for actions like "Schedule a Consultation" or "Download Our Guide."

As you scroll, the site weaves through three core pillars—Coordination, Planning, Support—each introduced with a brief, empathic paragraph set in modern sans‑serif body copy, followed by simple carousels of real‑life case studies and family testimonials. A soft fade between sections and a sticky footer in Ink Black help ground the experience, ensuring you always feel oriented. Timeless line‑art icons (a quill for planning, a clock for coordination, an open hand for support) provide visual signposts and echo the floral emblem's handcrafted poetry. Calls‑to‑action are framed in generous whitespace, using Moss Olive buttons with crisp white text to invite exploration without ever disrupting the calm.

Beyond the website, this aesthetic extends seamlessly into other touchpoints: email templates adopt the same ivory‑and‑charcoal headers with olive‑green accents, stationery uses debossed logos on textured off‑white paper, and social media posts lean on monochrome botanical sketches overlaid with heartfelt quotes in serif italics. Even the in‑person experience—printed brochures, signage at consult rooms, and business cards—carries the same balance of sacred tradition and modern minimalism. In every interaction, Evermore's digital and physical branding conveys a promise of care, dignity, and understated elegance.
